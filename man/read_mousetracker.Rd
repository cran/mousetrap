\title{Read data exported from MouseTracker.}
\usage{
read_mousetracker(file, remove_mean_data = TRUE, last_lines_to_rm = 0,
  remove_empty_columns = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{a character string. The name of the file which the data are to be
read from. If it does not contain an absolute path, the file name is 
relative to the current working directory.}

\item{remove_mean_data}{logical indicating if mean subject data (i.e., the 
aggregated trajectories) should be automatically detected and removed. This
only works for data from "time normalized analysis" in MouseTracker (see 
Details).}

\item{last_lines_to_rm}{integer indicating the number of last lines to omit 
from the imported data set. Typically used for data from "raw time 
analysis" in MouseTracker (see Details). This option is independent of 
\code{remove_mean_data}. The removal of the last lines is performed after 
the optional removal of the auto-detected mean data.}

\item{remove_empty_columns}{logical indicating whether columns containing NAs
only should be removed.}
}
\value{
A \link{data.frame}.

\description{
\code{read_mousetracker} imports data that was collected using MouseTacker 
(Freeman & Ambady, 2010) and exported to a \code{.csv} file through 
MouseTracker Analyzer. It focuses on the raw data, and provides several 
options to remove pre-processed aggregate data (see Details).
}
\details{
MouseTracker by default includes the (per subject) aggregated trajectories in
the exported data set. As these are typically not desired in the trial-based 
dataset, \code{read_mousetracker} provides several ways of removing them.

Data that stem from a "time normalized analysis" in MouseTracker Analyzer, 
can be read into R using \code{read_mousetracker} with default arguments (the
aggregated trajectory data are automatically detected and removed, as they 
are marked by a row labeled "MEAN SUBJECT-BY-SUBJECT DATA" in the \code{.csv}
file).

Data that stem from a "raw time analysis" in MouseTracker Analyzer, also 
usually contain the aggregated trajectory data. However, as they are not 
marked by a specific row label in the \code{.csv} file, the number of last 
lines that should be omitted has to be specified explicitly using the 
argument \code{last_lines_to_rm}. Typically, this number is two times the 
number of data files.

After reading the data into R, \link{mt_import_wide} can be used to prepare 
the trajectory data for analyses using the mousetrap library.

The current version of \code{read_mousetracker} has been tested with data 
exported from MouseTracker Version 2.82.
